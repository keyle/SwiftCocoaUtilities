### SwiftCocoaUtilities

A bunch of classes I made and use for my own sanity..

They solve my own problems to develop apps quickly.

I will add them as I go, note that I'm still relatively new to Swift. References are added in comments.

Contributions welcome.

- UserNotif - display growl-like notification right now, in one line
- Messages - pass messages around the app in a register/broadcast global BUS style (oldschool) system, with payload
- DropView - extends NSView to handle files of certain extensions to be dropped in the application window
- CustomWindow - transparent window basic setup
